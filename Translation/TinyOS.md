### TinyOS是什么？ ###

TinyOS is an open-source operating system designed for low-power wireless devices, such a sensor networks, ubiquitous computing, personal area networks, smart buildings and smart meters. TinyOS provides useful software abstractions of the underlying device hardware: for example, TinyOS can present a flash storage chip, which has blocks and sectors with certain erase/write properties, as a simple abstraction of a circular log. Providing useful, well-designed and heavily tested software abstractions greatly simplifies the job of application and system developers.

TinyOS是一个开源的用于低功耗无线设备的操作系统，例如传感网络，普适计算，基于蓝牙的个域网，智能建筑和智能电表。TinyOS提供了设备硬件上的抽象的软件层。
