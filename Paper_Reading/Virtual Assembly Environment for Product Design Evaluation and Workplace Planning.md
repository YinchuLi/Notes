##摘要
VR application oriented general software development platform, virtual model descriptions, virtual assembly operation based on constraint and degree of freedom analysis, multiple interaction mode and ergonmic evaluation for user's assembly operation and so on.

##1 介绍
###1.1 数字技术的趋势
With the advent of Virtual Reality(VR) technology, Virtual Protoyping(VP) and Virtual Manufacturing(VM) become the current focus area in digital technologies.

Two aims can be achieved by using virtual reality technology: increase the degree of freedom for product development, and obtain the high level details of information.

###1.2 建立虚拟装配环境的背景
The virtual testing environment, which is based on the virtual prototype and mapped to the real physical environment, provides an environment that doesn't consume any physical prototype cost.

###1.3 建立虚拟装配环境的目标
The purpose is to replace the functions of physical assembly environment with virtual environment as much as possible, and to provide a decision support for engineers with different professional knowledge.

###1.4 Three levels for assembly process oriented evaluation
There are three levels of method for digitized aid technologiees that are used for product assembly process evaluation: the automatic assembly with fixed path, the assembly based on virtual human model and the assembly with real operators by using VR peripherals.

##2 虚拟装配环境的系统结构
At the virtual assembly trial environment for assembly workplace planning, the opertot can use assembly tools, perform the anslysis of assebleability, record the assembly path, design the layout of workplace facilities, and do ergonomic evaluation.

##3 实现虚拟装配环境的关键点
The key point include: the general software platform VR-Flier, the differnet model descriptions in virtual assembly environment, the virtual assembly operation based on constraint and degree of freedom analusis, the interaction method in virtual assembly environment, and the Ergonomic evaluation for user's assembly operation, etc.

###3.1 面向虚拟现实的开发平台

###3.2 虚拟装配环境中的模型描述
The description of component includes geometrical information, design information, at the same time, the convenience of model organization and operation should be considered so as to meet the requirement of real time interaction.

###3.3 基于约束和自由度分析的虚拟装配操作

###3.4 虚拟装配环境中的多种交互模式

###3.5 用户装配操作的人体工学评价

##4 应用

##5 未来的工作
The haptic generation and feedback system can be set up, with this user can fell the grasped object.

In collaborative virtual assembly environment, components from different suppliers could be assembled into product conveniently, so that the assembly of product digital model could be checked and simulated at early design stage.
