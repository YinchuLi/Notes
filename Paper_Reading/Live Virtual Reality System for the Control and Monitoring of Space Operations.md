## 摘要 ##
The paper describes a work in progress relating to the development of a virtual monitoring environment for space telemanipulation systems.

## 1.介绍 ##
Currently, the control and monitoring of space operations, especially those that involve telemanipulators, are based on a man in-the-loop system where the operator looks at the worksite directly through a window, or indirectly through one or many video cameras.

By using live virtualized models created from various sensors located in a remote site such as the International Space Station(ISS) or mars, there is a real potrntial to improve the overall performance of such tele-operated systems.

The NRC Virtualized Reality(VR) toolkit will be used as the building block of a prototype system to evaluate the potential of virtualized reality technologies for space operations.

The toolkit allows for the direct connection between sensor data and graphic interaction with the operator in the VR world.

### 2.1任务分析 ###
Our task analysis focuses on the two currently operational space telemanipulators that are the SRMS and SSRMS.

2.1.4操作

Genrally, two operators are used to control the mainpulators. The first uses the controls, while the other is monitoring the activities.

### 2.2初步结果 ###
Such a system will also allows for the exploration and the experimental comparison of different ways to present the information about the environment, as well as different ways to control it through this new kind of human-machine interface.

## VR系统概述 ##
The objective is therefore to provide to an observer a vivid experiecne in which he will have the possibility to interactively visit and remotely explore an existing remote environment.

Currently, most Tele-presence systems use one of the following two approaches:

- Based on the use of multiple cameras, often-panoramic cameras, in order to obtain a large visual converage of the site.

- Consists in the prior acquisition of a 3D model of the site that can be used by a virtualized reality system during the telepresence experience.

The system must offer both at the same time; real-time unrestricted navigarion and live information that relflect the current site conditions.

Our system will use a 3D model of the remote site but the apperance of this 3D model will be regularly refreshed using information obtained from a set of cameras and sensors strategically located at the remote site thus allowing for live visualization.

The proposed system in composed of four main sub-sytems:

- A modelling station
- A VR based operator/ observer station
- A data communication controller
- An on board remote monitoring sensing system

From its workstation, the user will use NRC 3D visualization software to navigare in real time inside the remote site by specifying virtual displacemants.
