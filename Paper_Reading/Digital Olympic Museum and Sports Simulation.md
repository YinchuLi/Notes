Engine based scene and human edit enable users to deeply immerse into virtual environment and enable realtime rendering.

In order to implement the DOM system, we have researched and developed some techniques as follows:
1. Storage and search of multimedia data:
2. Modeling and rendering:
3. Simulation of sport and avatar:

2.1 System Structure

The DOM system uses techniques such as multimedia, network, distributed virtual reality, based on the model of Client/Server.

The server side is mainly for responding to requests from different clients, and providing services for them. It is composed of network service, database access interface, user management and service function.

2.2 Storytelling in DOM

2.3 Modeling and Rendering of DOM

The modeling includes two aspects: 3D object modeling and physical factors modeling.

In DOM system, we need to ensure the accuracy of the models, and avoid being felt rough and deformed on one hand. On the other hand, we need real-time rendering.

With serveral optimization technologies, we gain a relatively good result.

(1)Scene segmentation.

(2)Model optimization.

(3)Texture optimization.

##3 Virtual Reality Based Sports Simulation

3.1 Main Functionalities and Key Technologies

3.2 Typical Prototypes

##4 Conclusion and Future Work
There is a long way to go before implementing a complete DOM system, as the following:

(1)Support multiple avatars.

(2)Increase immersion.

(3)Integrate information retrieval module.
