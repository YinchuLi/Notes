###Abstract
This contribution presents a new specification technique for the conceptual design of advanced mechatronic systems along with a new approach to manage the development process of such systems.

##1 Virtual Prototyping in the Product Innovation Process

The product innovation process starts from the idea of a product or business and leads to the successful product launch. 

**The first cycle** characterizes the steps from finding the success potentials of the future to creating the promising product design.

- foresight
- product discovering
- business planning
- conceptual design
 
The aim of **foresight** is to recognize the potentials for future success.

The objective of **product discovering** is to find new product ideas.

**Business planning** is the final task in the cycle of strategic product planning. 

**The second cycle** corresponds to the established understanding of product development.

**The third and last cycle** focuses on manufacturing process development and the optimization of the product design with respect to manufacturing.

When we model products in the computer, we talk about the virtual product; in analogy we use the buzzwords virtual production or digital factory when we model the manufacturing system.

A virtual prototype represents not only shape but also functional features and behaviors.

##2 Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality(AR)

VR means a fully computer generated, three-dimensional environment, in which the engineer can interact with and manipulate a realistic representation of the product in real time. 

AR enriches the user's view on the real world with virtual objectsm, which are placed at right time and position regarding the user's perspective.

Firstly, VR stands for a **realistic rendering** of the product appearance (material, surface, colors) and behavior. Secondly, VR make use of **advanced display technologies** that allow the engineers to experience the virtual protype like a real one.

In VR, the engineer has to navigate in 3D-space and to manipulate 3D-objects. Therefor, **VR-specific devices for spatial interaction** like 3D-Mouse, 3D-Wands or gloves are needed.

The main challenge of AR technology is the **context-sensitive mixture of real world elements and computer generated objects in the user's field of view.**

##3 Up-to-date Applications of VR and AR in Industry

The following projects give a survey about how VR and AR technology could be applied in the product innovation process.

###3.1 Composing Mechatronic Systems in VR

###3.2 Virtual Prototyping of Headlight Systems

###3.3 AR in Vehicle Prototyping

##4 From Mechatronics to Self-Optimization
The varitety of mechatronic systems can be expressed by two categories:

- The first category is based on the spatial integration of mechanics and electronics.
- The second category deal with the controlled movements of multi-body systems.

Self-optimization takes place as a process that consists of the tree following actions, called the **Self-Optimization Process:**

 (1)**Analyzing the current situation:**
 
 (2)**Determining the system's objectives:**

 (3)**Adapting the system's behavior:**
