##摘要
For simulations of highly complex processes, we enable interactive exploration in 3D space by apllication of Virtual Reality(VR) technology.

##1.摘要
The primary requirement is to persistently maintain a minimum frame rate of 30 frames per second. In addition, response time to user input should not exceed 100 milliseconds. 

In order to adhere to the aforementioned requirements, we have developed the flow visulization framework ViSTA FlowLib and the parallelization system Viracocha.

##2.基于VR的仿真数据探索
2.1 A Hybrid Visualization Environment

The visualization front-end requires software components which deal with efficient rendering of data, user interaction and visulization algorithms for techniques which require low latency.

2.2 Scheduling Techniques

2.3 Interactive Particle Tracing

2.4 Interactive Feature Definition

##3.VR-based Process Exploration

3.1 Distributed Simulation Platform

3.2 Meta Data Model

3.3 Asserting Interactivity

3.4 Explorative Analysis of Multiple Data Sets

3.5 Linking Visualizations

##4.结论
In order to react to the growing complexity of simulation data, we have proposed the ViSTA FlowLib toolkit for interactive scientiic visualization in virtual environments.
