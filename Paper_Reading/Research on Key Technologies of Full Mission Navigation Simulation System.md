##摘要

The paper presents three realism specifications to evaluate a Full Mission Navigation Simulation System: behavioural realism, environmental realism and physical realism.

##1 介绍
Three essential realism specifications are used to evaluate a Full Mission Navigation Simulation System: behavioural realism, environmental realism and physical realism. 

Behavioural realism is determined by ship hydrodynmaic mathematic model; environmental realism is mainly determained by visual system; physical realism is mainly determained by the simluated bridge and equipment.

##2 Key Technologies

###2.1 Architecture of Full Mission Navigation Simulation System
Full Mission Navigation Simulation System adopts some advanced technologies, such as computer generating image technology, virtual reality and curve screen seamles tiling projection using software edge-blending technique with wide field of view.

###2.2 Ship Hydrodynamic Mathematic Model

###2.3 Visual System

###2.4 Mimic Ship Bridge and Equipments

##3 Conclusion
The system builds 6-DOF hydrodynamic mathematic model for each simulating object-"Ownship". The model will calculate ship's movement parameters in real-time according to real ship's particular data, navigational environment and control command when simulator has run. The motion parameters will transderred to visual system and console for display such as meters and conning display. After visual system has received the parameter, it can calculate visula parameters and generate 3-D virtual environment. PC-cluster and multi-ptojector are used in the visual system for generating and displaying the virtula environment.
