##Instantreality - A Framework for Industrial Augumented and Virtual Reality Applications

###摘要
This framework provides a comprehensive set of features to support classic Virtual Reality(VR) as well as mobile Augmented Reality(AR).

###1 Instantreality VR System

"Mixed Reality" describes the fusion of the virtual and real worlds as follows:

- Within Virtual Reality scenarios the user interacts with 3D digital objects in real time.
- Augmented Reality(AR) descriobes the real-time overlay of our real environment with digital information.

####1.1 Clustering and Distributed Rendering

The software framework to reach golobal application specific runtime goals:

- Cluster-based Rendering
- Multi-Resolution Datasets

####1.2 Semantic Modelling

Use Gemtric Modelling Language(GML)

####1.3 Interactive VR with Multi-touch

###2 Instantrality AR system

The AR systems are characterized by the following characteristics:

- Mobility: well-suited for mobile application.
- Real-tiem capability: the digital information is always superimposed on real objects in real time.
- Relation to context: Information is visualized through superimposition on real objects.
- Intuitiveness: The objects which are displayed consist primarily of graphic animations which guarantee that information is transmitted in a way that is easy to understand and independent of language.
- Interactivity: 

####2.1 Robust and Markerless Tracking

A hybrid, markerless tracking method based on the following data sources:

- Live video data streams:
- Intertial sensors:

####2.2 Augmented Reality Embedded Systems

###3 结论
The instantreality framework provides a complete set of tools and plug-ins to ease the integration of different data sources as well as the application development and deployment:

- Integration: Plug-ins for the most common digital content creation tools enable the application developer to integrate 3D data very efficiently.
- Composition: A special runtime environments allow the developer to integrate and compose data from different sources.
- Deployment: Various server and middleware systems can be utilized to delpoy the final applications on a wide number of hardware platforms.
